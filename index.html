# The Monad Pattern

---

# Disclaimer

Early days for me, this is my current understanding, happy to be corrected.

---

# I understand a Monad to be

A functional design pattern where you wrap a value or operation that you want to treat specially.

---

# Sometimes ...

```ruby
thing = get_thing()
# => #<Thing:0x007f84731bc2f0>
```

---

# ... and then ...

```ruby
thing = get_thing()
# => #<Thing:0x007f84731bc2f0>
thing.do_thing()
# => "Whooaa! I did my thing!"
```

---

# But what if ...?

```ruby
thing = get_thing()
# => nil
thing.do_thing()
# NoMethodError: undefined method `do_thing' for nil:NilClass
```

---

# So you end up with ...

```ruby
thing = get_thing()
# => nil
unless thing.nil?
  thing.do_thing()
else
  puts "Didn't get a thing :("
end
# Didn't get a thing :(
```

With several operations this leads to several nested checks for nil.

---

# Well, you know how ...

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].map do |x|
  x + 1
end
# => [2, 3, 4]
```

---

# Yet ...

```ruby
[].map do |x|
  x + 1
end
# => []
```

---

# And still further ...

```ruby
a = [].map do |x|
  x + 1
end
# => []

a.each do |x|
  puts x
end
# (no output)
```

---

# Well what if ...

You could treat a single value as a collection?

```ruby
thing = get_thing()
# => [#<Thing:0x007f84731bc2f0>]
```

---

# Then ...?

```ruby
thing = get_thing()
# => [#<Thing:0x007f84731bc2f0>]

thing_done = thing.map do |thing|
  thing.do_thing()
end
# => ["I did my thing!"]
```

---

# And

```ruby
thing = get_thing()
# => []

thing_done = thing.map do |thing|
  thing.do_thing()
end
# => []
```

---

# That would be a Monad

---

# Benefits

* Entirely declarative
* No distracting (usually nested) nil checking logic
* Promotes the positive case

# Costs

* You need to get familiar with ```map``` and friends
* You need a language which supports functions as first-class citizens
* Logic still needed at the end to check for empty collection

---

# There's a specific monad pattern for this: Option

Here's what the positive case looks like in Scala:

```scala
val thing: Option[String] = Some("Hello!")
// => thing: Option[String] = Some(Hello!)
val upperThing = thing.map { _.trim }
  .filter { _.length != 0 }
  .map { _.toUpperCase }
// => upperThing: Option[String] = Some(HELLO!)
println(upperThing.getOrElse("Oh no!")
// HELLO!
```

---

# Built-in support is even better: Swift

```swift
var thing: String? = "   SDFSDF   "
// => {Some "   SDFSDF   "}

thing = thing?.stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet(
  NSCharacterSet.whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet())
// => {Some "SDFSDF"}

thing = thing?.lowercaseString
// => {Some "sdfsdf"}

if let outThing = thing? {
  println(outThing)
  // sdfsdf
} else {
  println("No thing")
}
```

Note: the `bind` or `map` equivalent in Swift appears to be hidden, so only
method chaining is possible using the `?` operator.

---

# What other patterns are there?

* Try - to deal with exceptions that aren't exceptional
* Either - for two equivalent cases that must be handled differently
* State - the state pattern as a monad
* Future/Promise - code against future values that don't exist yet in async code

---

# A Stricter Definition: Monad Rules / Laws / Axioms

* `bind` is `flatMap`
* `unit` is the single-argument constructor
* Strictly, having a `map` makes it a functor, or something blah blah
* The rules guarantee compatible behaviour, composability etc
* Lot's of articles and papers

---

# Law 1: Identity (Right Unit)

```ruby
m.flatMap(unit) == m
```

Says that if you bind (flatMap) a monadic value to unit, you get back the
(equivalent of) the original value unchanged

---

# Law 2: Unit (Left Unit)

```ruby
unit(x).flatMap(f) == f(x)
```

If you wrap a value inside a unit, then bind (flatMap) to f, this is the same
as applying f to x

---

# Law 3: Composition (Associativity)

```ruby
m.flatMap(g).flatMap(f) == m.flatMap(->(x) { g(x).flatMap(f) })
```

Nesting calls to flatMap should be equivalent to calling them sequentially [9].
Used to enforce that monads compose nicely. Says that composing a new function
that applies f to g and then binding to m should be the same as applying m to
f then to g

# Further Reading

Philip Wadler’s (Haskell IO guy) “The essence of functional programming”

* Original paper introducing Monads
* Go to http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html
* Then search for “The essence of functional programming”

---

# How can I use them now?

* Ruby
  * There are some Gems (which?)
  * or just use an Array
  * See 'try' in ActiveSupport
* Scala - built-in or use scalaz
* Java - Google Guice (hint: use Scala or Clojure)
* Python - has map, functools, itertools etc for iterable types
* Clojure - need to check
* Erlang / Elixir - need to check
* Swift - built-in Option as we've seen

# The End

Thank you!

* Not so good?
* Puzzles?
* Suggestions?
